### OUTPUT RULES

- Include **all keys** even if some arrays are empty (`[]`) or values are empty strings (`""`).
- No commentary, explanation, or prose before or after the JSON.
- Double-check that brackets and commas make valid JSON.
- Before returning, recheck that your JSON is strictly valid.
  Remove stray commas, mismatched quotes, or dangling punctuation that
